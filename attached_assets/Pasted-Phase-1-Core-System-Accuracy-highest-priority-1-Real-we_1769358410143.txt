Phase 1: Core System Accuracy (highest priority)

1) Real weight-change intelligence (no more guessing)

PWM will now calculate from logs:
	•	Overnight change
Last night log → next morning log
	•	Session change
Pre practice → post practice
	•	3 day rolling averages for both

Why this matters:
This turns PWM into a predictive system, not a static tracker. It mirrors how you actually coach cuts using overnight loss and practice response as anchors.

If logs are missing, the app prompts:

“Log morning + night to unlock overnight trend.”

⸻

2) Date logic fully fixed and reactive
	•	All dates stored consistently and recalculated immediately when edited
	•	Phase, time remaining, targets, and dashboard guidance update instantly
	•	No more “date won’t change” or stale projections

Why this matters:
Dates drive everything in a phase based cut system. This removes silent errors.

⸻

Phase 2: Education without overload

3) Tappable weekly timeline (guided learning)

Each day or phase in the weekly timeline becomes tappable.

Tap a day → Day Preview sheet shows:
	•	Phase name and purpose
	•	Today’s top 2–4 rules (based on Goal + Track + Phase)
	•	Allowed vs avoid foods when relevant
	•	Hydration reminder
	•	Plain language “what moves the scale today”

Why this matters:
This turns your system into a built in course, without adding content screens or forcing reading.

⸻

4) Phase ribbon stays visible at the top
	•	Mon–Wed Metabolic
	•	Thu Transition
	•	Fri Prep
	•	Weigh In
	•	Recovery

Current phase is always highlighted.

Why this matters:
Wrestlers stop asking “what day are we on?” The app teaches rhythm automatically.

⸻

Phase 3: Daily compliance tools

5) Hydration tracking (simple and dumb on purpose)
	•	One tap to add a standard fluid amount
	•	Progress bar toward daily target
	•	Target automatically adapts to standard mode or coach mode

Why this matters:
Hydration compliance improves dramatically when logging is frictionless.

⸻

6) Fiber elimination becomes unavoidable late week

On transition and prep days:
	•	Persistent banner appears
	•	Clear allowed vs avoid list
	•	No macros, no math

Why this matters:
This is one of the highest ROI levers in your system and now it’s enforced at the right time.

⸻

Phase 4: Competition execution

7) Automatic recovery mode takeover

On weigh in day:
	•	Dashboard switches to Weigh In / Recovery Mode
	•	Logging weigh in weight launches the recovery mission automatically

Why this matters:
On competition day, nobody should be navigating menus. The app becomes a checklist and timer.

⸻

8) Recovery mission runs the show
	•	Large start button
	•	Timed phases
	•	One section at a time
	•	Checkboxes for execution

Why this matters:
Your recovery protocol only works if it’s executed precisely. This removes friction and decision fatigue.

⸻

Phase 5: System clarity and credibility

9) Terminology cleanup
	•	Only Goal / Cut Type
	•	Only Track A / Track B
	•	Only defined Phase names

No bodybuilding language. No mixed metaphors.

Why this matters:
Trust. Wrestlers and coaches feel when language doesn’t match the room.

⸻

10) Guidance levels respected everywhere
	•	Beginner: just actions and targets
	•	Intermediate: fuel tank logic and track explanation
	•	Advanced: coach gated tools and deeper rules

Why this matters:
The same app works for a freshman and a national qualifier.

⸻

Big picture assessment

After these updates, PWM becomes:
	•	A coach in the pocket
	•	A teaching system without lectures
	•	A daily execution tool, not a data dump

Most weight cut apps answer:

“What do I weigh?”

PWM answers:

“What lever is moving, what phase I’m in, and what to do next.”

If you want, next we can:
	•	Tune Today’s Mission language to feel even more “coach voice”
	•	Add a team level coach dashboard
	•	Stress test the system on same day vs day before scenarios
