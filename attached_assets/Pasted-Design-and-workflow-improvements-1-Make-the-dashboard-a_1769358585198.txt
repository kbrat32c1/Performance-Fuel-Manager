Design and workflow improvements
	1.	Make the dashboard a three layer stack, always in the same order
Status (on track / borderline / high risk) → Today’s Mission → Logs and metrics.
If anything pushes Today’s Mission below the fold on phone, shrink or collapse it.
	2.	Add a single “Next target” line that’s always visible
Example: “Tonight post practice target: 162.0”
Your system lives on targets. Everything else is support.
	3.	Add “What to log next” as a micro prompt under Quick Log
If morning log is missing, show “Log Morning weight to unlock overnight trend.”
This turns logging into a guided habit.
	4.	Convert education into tap to reveal, not walls of text
System Philosophy should be 5 bullets max, then “Learn more.”
Beginners should never scroll to learn.
	5.	Use consistent naming and stop synonyms
Pick one: Today’s Mission or Today’s Focus.
Pick one: Goal or Cut Type.
Pick one: Session or Practice.
Consistency is trust.
	6.	Make the phase ribbon non scrollable if possible
If it requires horizontal scrolling, many users won’t notice it.
Try a compact 5 step ribbon that fits every phone width.
	7.	One tap Day Preview from the ribbon
Tapping Thu should instantly show “Fiber elimination active” plus Allowed/Avoid.
This becomes your built in “coach talk.”
	8.	Create a “Beginner safe” dashboard mode
Beginner mode should hide tanks and advanced concepts by default.
Keep it as actions, targets, hydration, and red flags.
	9.	Add a “Coach voice” tone to action copy
Make each action start with a verb and be doable.
Avoid extreme or absolute language that can get misapplied.
	10.	On weigh in day, takeover should be automatic
No navigation. No hunting.
Dashboard becomes Recovery Mission until the athlete exits it.

System and logic improvements
	1.	Make the Five Fuel Tanks visible as a simple explanation, not a chart
Show “Scale movement today is likely from gut + glycogen” rather than pretending precision.
The goal is education and decision guidance.
	2.	Track A/B should be the only track language
Avoid additional protocol labels that dilute your framework.
If you want off season body comp modes later, place them in a separate section.
	3.	Phase rules should drive what appears on screen
Thu and Fri should automatically show the fiber elimination module.
Mon to Wed should show metabolic phase reminders.
	4.	Use real log based drift, not estimates
Overnight change and session change must come from logs and have a 3 day average.
This is the predictive backbone.
	5.	Add “Performance cost” warnings tied to tank order
If the plan is leaning on fluid loss too early, flag it.
Keep the wording coach safe and conservative.
	6.	Add an auto “plan correction” suggestion
If off pace by more than a threshold, the app should adjust today’s mission rather than just warn.
	7.	Include “Coach mode gating” clearly
Anything advanced should show a lock icon and “Coach enabled.”
No hidden toggles.
	8.	Recovery should compute a simple plan from pounds lost
Even if you keep it conservative, it should personalize the checklist and fluids guidance.
	9.	Add between match fueling prompts during tournament mode
This can be a simple repeating checklist and timer style prompt.
	10.	Make date edits re compute everything instantly
If any derived values don’t update on changing weigh in date or match time, it’s a bug.
This should be testable in one minute.

Bug and confusion hot spots to test
	•	Changing weigh in date in settings updates dashboard phase and countdown instantly
	•	Editing match start time doesn’t break timezone or shift phase incorrectly
	•	Logs saved and displayed consistently, no duplicates
	•	Overnight change calculates across midnight correctly
	•	Pre practice and post practice logs are paired properly
	•	Beginner mode hides advanced items but doesn’t hide critical warnings
	•	Weigh in day takeover triggers on the correct day and doesn’t trap users

Copy and education improvements that make it coach grade
	•	Add a one sentence “Why” under Today’s Mission that can expand
Example: “This phase protects power by controlling gut content and glycogen timing.”
Then expand to show a 3 bullet explanation.
	•	“Allowed/Avoid” lists should be visually scannable chips, not paragraphs.

Fast way to get this into Replit Agent

Paste this into Replit Agent as the next task list:
	•	Make dashboard prioritize Today’s Mission above the fold
	•	Ensure Track A/B and Goal labels are consistent everywhere
	•	Add tappable phase ribbon day previews with rules and allowed/avoid
	•	Implement log based overnight and session change with 3 day averages
	•	Add hydration progress bar with one tap increments and undo
	•	Trigger recovery takeover on weigh in day automatically
	•	Audit date edits to re compute countdown, phase, and targets instantly
